        <p>An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.The longer he lived the more vile he became and the more bitter were his words. People avoided him  because his misfortune became contagious. It was unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him. He poisoned others with unhappiness. But one day when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour: "The old man is happy today, he doesn't complain about anything, smiles and even his face is fresh." The whole village gathered together. The village asked the old man what happened to him. He replied,"Nothing special. Eighty years Ive been chasing happiness and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That is why I'm happy now." 
        The moral of the story is don't chase happiness. Just enjoy your life.

        <p>Two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt but without saying anything wrote in the sand, "Today my best friend slapped me in the face."they kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but his friend saved him. After he recovered from almost drowning, he wrote on a stone, "Today my best friend saved my life." The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, "I hurt you, then you wrote in the sand, now I saved you and you wrote it on a stone. Why?" The other friend replied, "When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it." Moral of the story: Don't hold grudges. Remember the good deeds, not the bad.</p></div>
